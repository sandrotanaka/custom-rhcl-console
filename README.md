# Kuadrant Console

**An opinionated OpenShift Console plugin for [Red Hat Connectivity Link](https://docs.kuadrant.io) (RHCL / Kuadrant).**

API management, AI gateways and MCP — told in the language of the people who run them.

## Why this exists

RHCL / Kuadrant is a powerful engine — Gateways, HTTPRoutes, AuthPolicies,
RateLimitPolicies, TokenRateLimitPolicies, DNS and TLS — but it hands you those
primitives as raw Kubernetes CRs, with no opinion about how they fit together.
Even a simple question — *"how do I identify a consumer?"* — takes real
expertise to answer from YAML alone.

**Kuadrant Console adds the opinion.** It re-frames those primitives into views
that API owners, developers and SREs recognize on sight — API Products,
operational dashboards, cost, an AI-gateway lens, MCP servers — so a customer
can *see* what the platform is doing, simply and practically. It invents
nothing new on the cluster; it organizes what Kuadrant already exposes.

> **Real-only, honest gaps.** Every value is computed from live cluster,
> Prometheus, cert-manager and DNS state. Signals that genuinely can't be
> measured render as a greyed **N/A** — never faked, never counted against a
> health score. That keeps the picture credible to a technical audience.

It's **read-only first** and carries **no service-account of its own**: every
API call rides the signed-in user's bearer token, so people see exactly what
their cluster RBAC allows — nothing more.

## What's inside

| Area | Screens |
|---|---|
| **API management** | API Products · API Overview (address, paths, plans, auth, traffic, keys) · Plans · API Keys with approve / reject · guided **Create-API wizard** · Developer Portal link |
| **Operations** | Environment **Overview** · Gateway **operations dashboard** (health, security score, topology, capacity) · HTTPRoutes & GRPCRoutes with backend health · Policy coverage & effective-stack resolution |
| **AI & MCP** | **AI Gateway lens** — token governance, throttling, per-consumer cost, live chat playground · **MCP Servers** — catalog, tools/prompts, in-console try-it |
| **Reliability** | **DNS** Overview + Troubleshooting · **TLS** Overview + Troubleshooting (expiry, issuer, chain) · **Cost Monitoring** per consumer |
| **Everywhere** | RBAC-aware empty states (explain the missing permission, no 403 toasts) · the API-owner views never expose YAML |

See [`SPECIFICATION.md`](SPECIFICATION.md) for the full requirements
(FR-001 – FR-026, NFR-001 – NFR-011).

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** OpenShift 4.19+, the Kuadrant operator (RHCL) with at least
one Gateway, and `oc`. User-workload monitoring is optional — metric panels
degrade gracefully without it.

```bash
# 1. Build & push the plugin image (nginx serving the webpack bundle).
#    Skip this and use the published image if you don't need a custom build:
#      quay.io/gateway-smashes/kuadrant-console:1.5.1
#    --platform matters: OpenShift nodes are x86-64, and podman on an Apple
#    Silicon Mac defaults to arm64, which the cluster cannot run.
cd console-plugin
podman build --platform linux/amd64 -t quay.io/<org>/kuadrant-console:latest .
podman push  quay.io/<org>/kuadrant-console:latest

# 2. Deploy the plugin server + register + enable it
#    (full manifests, TLS notes and verification in docs/deployment.md)
oc new-project kuadrant-console
# … apply the Service + Deployment + ConsolePlugin (see docs/deployment.md) …
oc patch console.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=json \
  --patch='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/plugins/-","value":"kuadrant-console"}]'
```

The Console reloads and a **Connectivity Link** section appears in the admin
navigation. The plugin serves over **HTTPS on port 9001** with a
service-CA-signed certificate — the single most common first-time mistake is
deploying it over plain HTTP, which surfaces as *"Failed to get a valid plugin
manifest"*. The full, copy-pasteable deployment (with that TLS mount) lives in
**[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)**.

> The plugin registers with the Console under the technical name
> `kuadrant-console`; **Kuadrant Console** is its product name.

## Configuration

Deep links to Grafana / Tempo, and optional sidebar links (Developer Portal,
Internal Developer Hub) are driven at runtime by a ConfigMap — no rebuild
needed. Everything is optional and falls back to sensible defaults.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kuadrant-console-config
  namespace: kuadrant-console
data:
  grafanaNamespace: monitoring
  grafanaRouteName: grafana
  tempoNamespace: tempo
  developerPortalUrl: https://developer-portal.example.com   # omit to hide the item
```
